# Javascript

Each file in the **/js** directory will be concatenated into a single **/js/scripts.js** file.

Please use multiple files rather than stuffing all javascript into a single file.


## Validation

[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is being used to validate javascript.

The gulp task `gulp validate:js` can be used to easily validate all javascript.

By default, any javascript files in the `vendor` directory will not be validated since they will come from third parties.

## Vendor directory

The `vendor` directory can be used to add third party libraries that have not already been added via Bower. It is preferable to use Bower if at all possible.
